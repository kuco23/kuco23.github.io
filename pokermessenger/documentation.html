      <h2>Intro</h2>
      This is the documentation for the PokerMessenger app
      that allows playing poker on messinger.
      Its depency is the fbchat module, which is used for I/O.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Basics</h2>
      The basis of this application is the Dealer account,
      which can be set to any facebook account.
      It is recommended for the application user to set up a new account,
      reserved for the Dealer, or use some other abandoned account.<br />
      The Dealer's account will be automated to send game information
      (eg. name of the player whose action is expected, player cards)
      to users and group threads initialized as poker tables.<br />
      Any player that is removed from the group by someone other than himself
      will be added back by the Dealer.
      If the Dealer is removed from the table you will receive a death threat.
      <br />

      <h2>Player Rules</h2>

      <h3>New Player introduction</h3>
      Any player that is playing a round for the first time will
      get 4000 as a starting money amount.<br />
      All the players' info is logged in a database on the server,
      including his name, where he lives, the names of parents and any
      close relatives.
      (that my dear sir has been a joke... or has it been?).

      <h3>Player Money</h3>
      Players' money is logged with other info in a database on the server.
      Player's money and the money that he currently plays with are seperated.
      The money that player plays with is entirely within the game and
      can be withdrawn anytime by sending a statement that excludes you from the
      table or by leaving the group thread, that the game is being played on.<br />
      <br />
      The outside money is seen as the money you can use to buy in to play on
      other tables, that require a certain amount of money to participate in.<br />
      If player's outside money is less than game buy-in of 1000, player
      can buy in with all of his money to play in the game,
      else he must put 1000 of his outside money in game to participate.<br />
      <br />
      The table money is seen as the money you currently play with on a certain table.
      You can leave the table and transfer your table money to the outside money
      (with a statement).
      Table money can be lost if the dealer is removed from a table mid-round.

      <h2>Game Continuation</h2>

      When the series of rounds are initialized, the dealer takes the
      blinds according to the button (first player) position.
      Then it is the first player after the button's turn to
      act with one of <a href='#midRoundActions'>these</a> possible statements.
      After the player's turn is succesfully ended, the next
      player in line is asked for input on these same actions.
      If everyone, that has not folded their hand or is not all in,
      has inputed an action and the amount of money in pot from everyone is
      higher than those all in, and equal amongst those not all in
      and not folded, than the next round turn is initialized.<br />
      There are 3 round turns: flop, turn and river. At flop three cards
      are revealed, while turn and river reveal one card.
      When river is succesfully ended with more than one participating
      player who has not folded their hand, the player cards are revealed,
      the winner announced and the pot added to his table money.
      If at any stage there is only one player who has not folded left,
      he collects the pot money without other's cards being shown.<br />
      If at any stage there is no players whose inputs are required and
      one or none active players (eg. two players that are all in),
      then every stage is initialized without asking for input and after
      the river players' cards are revealed and the winner announced.<br />

      Every round is pre-configured to begin another one after it ends, so
      with this statenebt it is possible to interrupt the following round's

      The statement must be sent from a participating player as those not
      participating are considered not in the game and can only observe.
      After ::lastround is sent to the table from a participating player it
      ends the game after the round is finished.
      The ::lastround command can be canceled (toggled)
      by sending ::lastround once again.
      After the game has ended it can be restarted by
      sending ::init to the group<br />

      the largest amount of the money put in the pot of any player on the table.
      If a player does not have enough to equalize, then his money is all
      put in to the pot and his input is no longer required
      as he is competing for the money put in pot by other players equal
      to his amount in the pot.
      <span class = 'sttmnt'>check</span>
      This is the same as call 0. It is only considered valid if the
      author of the statement's share in pot is already equalized with other's.
      <span class = 'sttmnt'>fold</span>
      This folds the player's hand, eliminating him from the current round pot
      competition.
      <span class = 'sttmnt'>raise N</span>
      This raises the author's amount of money in the pot by N, where N is
      a non-negative integer.
      If N >= author's left table money, than he is considered all in and the
      money put in the pot is everything he has left.
      N = 0 is the same as call.
      <span class = 'sttmnt'>all in</span>
      This puts all the player's money in the pot. His input is no longer
      requred after that.<br />
