    <div>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      This page serves as the documentation for the PokerMessenger app
      that enables poker to be played on messenger.
      Its depency is the fbchat module, which is used for io.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Basics</h2>
      The basis of this application is the dealer account.
      The username and password for the account need to be provided
      to the PokerMessenger app configuration file.
      It is recommended for the application user to set up a new account,
      reserved for the dealer, or use some other abandoned account.<br />
      The account will be automated to send game information
      to users and group threads, initialized as poker tables.
      Those group threads will be referred as poker tables throughout
      the page.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Poker Players</h2>

      <h3>New Player introduction</h3>
      Every player has to initialize himself, by signing up.
      Any player that has signed up for the first time will
      get the default amount of 4000 as startup money.
      That money can be spent by depositing a buy-in of 1000
      on a poker table.
      <br />

      <h3Player Money</h3>
      There is an important distinction between the user money and
      the money deposited on a poker table. The main idea is for the
      user money to remain static during game participation, therefore
      not being affected by changes in poker table money.
      <br /><br />
      <b class="blue">User Money:</b>
      Is used for buying in games that are being played on poker tables.
      After buying in a game, the buy-in amount is withdrawn from the
      user money and deposited on a table.
      <br /><br />
      <b class="blue">Table Money:</b>
      Is used for playing with and can at most times be withdrawn
      back to user money.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Game Continuation</h2>

      The exact statements that are referred here are defined
      <a href='#statements'>here</a>.<br />
      For a concrete example of a game being played checkout
      <a href='#gameexample'>this</a>.

      <h3>Game Preparation</h3>
      Before starting any game, you must initialize a
      group thread as a poker table.
      After the poker table is defined, there must be at least
      2 and at most 9 players who buy in the game.
      When all the players have bought into the game,
      the series of rounds can be started by one of the participants.

      <h3>Round Rules</h3>
      A round consists of players being asked for their input, according
      to the poker rules, which you can examine at
      <a target='_blank'
         href='https://www.partypoker.com/how-to-play/texas-holdem.html'
      >this site</a>.
      When valid input is provided, the game initializes appropriate steps.
      Invalid player inputs are ignored,
      so players can talk freely with each other without game interruption.
      Every round is followed by another one, if certain conditions are met,
      though any player can break the cycle (by sending a statement).

      <h2>Advanced options</h2>
      <h3>Changing the default configuration</h3>
      Inside the PokerMessenger app, there is a folder named config,
      which includes .ini files, which configure the app's variables.
      This includes the definitions of valid player inputs,
      responses to those inputs from the dealer,
      poker data representation (eg. card representation) and
      default money settings (eg. default player starting money).<br />
      Change the configuration for a more generalized poker game.
